# Store Sales Dashboard with Forecasting (Power BI)

###  Business Use Case

This project visualizes and forecasts store sales performance using Power BI. Built for a retail store's decision-makers, the dashboard helps track revenue trends, product performance, returns, and regional breakdowns  with a special focus on sales forecasting for better inventory and marketing planning.

###  Why I Built This

I wanted to simulate the role of a business analyst working for a retail chain. Using a transactional dataset with over 20 columns, I created an interactive dashboard using *Power BI*, integrated *DAX measures*, *forecasting analytics*, and *Power Query* for data cleaning. The final solution supports insights into customer behavior, profits, and future demand prediction.


###  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI** – For dashboard design & forecasting visuals  
- **Power Query** – Data transformation  
- **DAX** – Custom calculations (e.g., YoY growth, profit ratio)  
- **Time Intelligence** – Sales forecasting using built-in Power BI models  
- **OLAP Concepts** – Filtering, slicing by segment, geography, category

### Key Dashboard Features

- Regional & category wise sales performance  
- Customer segmentation by profit and quantity  
- Profit vs Sales vs Returns comparison  
- Forecasting future sales using Power BI’s predictive model  
- Filters by time range, location, product, and customer segment
